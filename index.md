# PiCar-Client
==============================

### THIS IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT

This is a simple android app that allows you to connect to a
Raspberry Pi running [piCar](https://github.com/jerome1232/PiCar),
view it's Mjpeg stream from a piCar, and control it using a virtual joystick.

##### Software required:

These will need to be install on the Pi.

- [PiCar](https://github.com/jerome1232/PiCar)
  
  This will allow you to control the PiCar over the network.

- [Mjpeg Streamer](https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer)
  
  This will allow you to stream mjpeg images from a camera to this app.
  
I'd recomend setting the Pi up as it's own access point that you connect to via WiFi
so that it's not limited to staying near another access point.
