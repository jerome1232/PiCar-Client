# PiCar-Client
==============================

### THIS IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT

This is a simple android app that allows you to connect to a
Raspberry Pi running [piCar](https://github.com/jerome1232/PiCar),
view it's Mjpeg stream from a piCar, and control it using a virtual joystick.

##### Software required:

These will need to be installed on the Pi.

- [PiCar](https://jerome1232.github.io/PiCar/): Allows control of a PiCar over the network.
- [Mjpeg Streamer](https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer): Allows pi car to stream mjpeg of camera over network.
  
I'd recomend setting the Pi up as it's own access point that you connect to via WiFi
so that it's not limited to staying near another access point. Instructable will be forthcoming on that.
